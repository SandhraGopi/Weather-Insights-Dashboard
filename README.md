##  Data Flow

1. Raw weather data is collected in CSV format  
2. Data is cleaned and transformed using Python  
3. Cleaned data is exported as a new CSV file  
4. Power BI uses the cleaned data to build visuals  
5. An interactive dashboard is created for analysis  

---

##  Dashboard Features

- Daily high temperature trend  
- Average temperature by month and weather condition  
- Rainfall vs visibility analysis  
- Air Quality Index (AQI) distribution  
- Interactive slicers for:
  - Month
  - Weather condition
  - Temperature category
  - AQI category  

---

##  Data Cleaning & Transformation

Performed using Python:
- Handling missing values
- Formatting dates
- Creating derived columns (Month Name, Categories)
- Exporting cleaned data for Power BI usage

Code is available in the **project** folder.
